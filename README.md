## 🧪 Home Lab Project: Active Directory Domain Services

## Lab 01 – Active Directory Domain Deployment

### 📌 Objective
Deploy and validate a Windows Active Directory domain in a virtualized home lab using pfSense for routing and DNS resolution.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used / Lab Environment

- Virtualization: Oracle VirtualBox
- Network: pfSense (NAT + Internal LAN)
- Domain: lab.local
- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- DNS
- Windows 11 Client (Domain Joined)


### 🔍 Key Tasks Performed
- Installed and configured Active Directory Domain Services
- Promoted Windows Server to Domain Controller
- Configured DNS forward lookup zones
- Joined Windows 11 client to the domain
- Verified connectivity using `ipconfig`, `nslookup`, and domain login
- Validated domain membership via Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

### 📸 Evidence (Screenshots)
